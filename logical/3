Challenge
30 fans hire a bus to attend a Football game. On the way to the field they realize that exactly half of them are fans of one team,
and the other half are fans of the other team. With still some way to go before reaching the field, the bus develops mechanical problems 
and the driver announces to his passengers that only way to continue the journey is for half of them to get out and walk. 
There is a huge fight that doesnt stop until the bus driver suggests a way of selecting people to get off the bus. 
"All of u" he said" get into a big circle when we are ready beginning at this spot. Ill count to nine people clockwise. 
The ninth person leaves the circle and continues on foot. And so on until 15 people have left the circle." 
Suppose u are one of the fans. How can u arrange all the other fans of your team so that none of them will have to walk?
There are 30 people on the bus not including the driver you are on team A(15 PPL) and the other team is on team B(15 PPL).... now arrange!

Solution
Draw on a piece of paper numbers 1 to 30 in a circle. Count to 9 clockwise ,scratch off the 9th person and continue until 15 are left.
